Rules of Linux C User Space Application Coding
----------------------------------------------
by Peter, Yu, Yaoyang & Qige.

Only suitable for User Space Applications.

1. Packages Naming: "gws_*" or "gws{N}k_*";
	Eg. "gws_abb", "gws5k_radio".

2. Library Function Naming: "{abb|gws}_*_{get|set}{_instant}()";
	Eg. "abb_snr_get_instant()", "gws_txpwr_get()".

	2.1 If function is called internally, must declare it as "static";
		And the function name should be lower case.

	2.2 If function is called externally, must declear it in ".h" file;
		And the function name should be Capitalized.

	2.3 The return value should be int/ENUM values all the time, 
		except "get_name()", "get_ssid()", etc.

	2.4 The parameters that passing in for framework function,
		like "function pointer", 
		if it's a pointer, should be transfered to "void *";

	2.5 All parameters should be reclaimed with internal arguments;

	2.6 All arguments should be initialized right after claimed；

	2.7 Use "static", "volatile", "const".

3. Architecture
User Application
       |
  Library API
       |
  ABB, Radio

4. Hardware Independent
	Package "gws{N}k_radio" will use function pointer to avoid
	User Apps calling hardware directly.

5. Data Interfaces
	5.1 Use "|" pipe;
	5.2 Use "/tmp" or "/var" files;
	5.3 Use "shm";
	5.4 Use "msg".
